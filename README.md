python-uniqid
=============

Generate a unique ID, à la PHP.

I've run into enough cases where I want to get the exact equivalent of PHP’s uniqid function.

One snippet I found on the internet, [here](http://gurukhalsa.me/2011/uniqid-in-python/), had imperfections, and appeared to be slow. This was probably due to the fact that it did not actually follow the implementation PHP used. This led me to create this repository.
